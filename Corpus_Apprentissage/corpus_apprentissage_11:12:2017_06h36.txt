Ok.
@mvirkkunen But props for frontpage and Courier, I’ll give this 1.5/5.
@mvirkkunen Just that your `export const` requires a compiler to target browsers not supporting the ES6 module syntax.
@mvirkkunen Smells like tryhard to me, missing the Comic Sans tho 😕
@mvirkkunen Wow so you’re one of these Chomre or Firefox, the rest can just sid off -people?
@mvirkkunen Etoo bad _ is a bit idiotic with tis argument order, would be even shorter than #newfangledframework
@mvirkkunen Underscore is cute. :3
But after getting more familiar with how things work, having a sanity check of sorts which all reasoning is more or less built on, is great.
Realized that ever since diving into the world of FP, the identity function is something that probably for non-FP persons might feel like a total weirdo; why would you want a function that just returns the same thing you give it?
@sunjammer Damn, son. That game is the dope. Have to dig up mine, whereever it's hidden at home.

@Jet0o Mostly just using it for audio routing while streaming. Easier to route mic + mixer through it and apply compression + EQ + limiter than in OBS alone.

And maybe some music at times.
@GolDDranks English is so hard to speak. Not language-wise, but after finnish/japanese, it takes some serious effort to just move your mouth. Annoying.
You know what time it is? #Overwatch time! Tune in for some warmup and maybe even some comp climb!

@Jet0o Yeah. I think the easiest might be if you have Node.js installed, you can install it with `npm install -g tldr`

Don't have the filter you want while video editing? No problem, just use some GLSL! What a time to be alive. 
Been running one-player custom games in #Overwatch just looking through the levels in spectator mode, and appreciating the amount of detail the levels have. So much tiny detail you most of the times just miss.
Right now I'd really appreciate a CUDA-compatible card. OpenCL feels so glacially slow. Outside of games, that is.

Want to know what lenses are in programming? Jump into my stream and maybe come out a little bit wiser in that field! Covering basics on what they are and what they do, and how we can benefit from them!  
Stream delayed 10 minutes, starts at around 18:10 EEST (16:10 UTC). Sorry for the wait! 
Having some connectivity issues with streaming, hopefully will be able to resolve it before stream start in 10min

Depending on the speed of implementing and going through the matter, it might be split into multiple streams, but still, roughly what’s going to be covered.

Spreading the love for #Calmm, in the name of less clutter and boilerplate. UI doesn’t have to be hard!
Though about doing a stream this thursday on the topic of partial lenses basics, using lenses to consume web API data,  and from there to reusing the lenses to show how structural programming can be beneficial to cresting a very reusable set of UI components. #calmm
A bunch of eager programmers cloning the project repository and looking at the sources:

Partial Lenses Exercises:  #wip #javascript #calmm #klipse
The downsides with this though, it will hurt to be without them. But suddenly, asynchronous Javascrip is fun!
Not to mention, that Observables are lazy, compared to the eager nature of Promises. Going into Observables at start may hurt (your head) a bit, but it's very worth the effort.
In general, if you're not going full-on imperative with your programming, Observables are worth your time. They're like Promises done right, and then some more.

Don't start with RxJS though. Use Kefir instead. RxJS is so outlandisly MS'y in its documentation. #es7 #javascript
Here we see a react engineer deploying a contact form 
@Sohaib_Nehal Not really, if we're thinking of those things as data structures, while async/await does an implicit Promise resolve/reject-throw under the hood. Which I think is good for imperative-style stuff, try-catching rejected Promises there and then.
@vivainio @VesaKarvonen In an imperative environment most likely yeah, if thinking of data as pure Javascript values. Passing boxed values (Promises, Observables) around is cleaner, but the advantages are partly lost because of the eager nature of Promises.
@apexvj @TheBaggers Damn… ( 　ﾟ,_ゝﾟ)
@vivainio @VesaKarvonen How come? Of course, using Bluebird et.al. vs native Promises has its own share of issues.
I still think #Javascript #ES7 async/await is dangerous from the sense that you don't have to be familiar with how Promises work. It feels a little bit like an antipattern to me.
@otonpii うほ、マジ全部を全く忘れちゃった。。。

Also, noise canceling headphones are the real MVP. Commutes are much more bearable this way.
Every time the world feels like a hectic place I’d pop on the Aria trilogy soundtracks, and it’d just have that wonderful calming effect.
I remember eight years ago taking a trip to Venice inspired by that series, and it was wonderful. Cold, but wonderful still.
12 years after the first Aria soundtrack was released, it’s still one of my favorite albums. It’s just so wonderful.
@CirNobar I know some of these words.
@paavohtl This makes me unreasonably upset. Horrible, horrible idea. Jesus.
@otonpii ｶﾞﾀｯ
@Petterroea Well, once you pop, you can't stop. BTW, check out outside of Tokyo, it's even more awesome.
@CirNobar Was probably around the central roundabout in the smack-middle of town?

@TescoKetamine @dopefish_lives Pu'erh tea or just GTFO.

But in general brewing tea in hotter _water_, then adding whatever you add. If the milk is equally hot, why not.
Dealing with App Store submission, certs, etc is probably going to be sufficient motivation to start with a PWA for many devs
It’s very weird to revisit Oslo now. Thinking “I used to live here”, this was just a half year ago.

@MerryNitemare That’s true yeah. Not from the US, but what’s taught in history classes often seems to skip over the critical stuff.
@Jet0o But it’s almost correct, I’m amazed! Also needs more Kvikk Lunsj ( 　ﾟ,_ゝﾟ)

@drboolean @galstar @VesaKarvonen @reactjs @ryanflorence In retrospect, almost 6mo full-time Calmm in a project, things are looking very pretty after fellow devs get up to speed.
@drboolean @galstar @VesaKarvonen @reactjs @ryanflorence +1 for Calmm. Observables may be a headache at start, but applicative-style handling with lenses = molto bella!

@Jet0o Depending on how long the injector’s veen used it might get destroyed in the process of removal due to a ton of soot making it stuck.
@Jet0o Had some major help from my dad, who has been a mechanic for some tens of years. Annoying process and injectors are a bit expensive.
@Jet0o At least was a good test run to see if it works, across Sweden and Norway, almost 4k kilometres.
@Jet0o Yeah, had the same issue with my C4. Was quite the project!

@ThumperGame Those turns are so oddly satisfying to get right—with that kind of knife-swooshing sound—and going on while in the zone. So good!
The only downside is that @ThumperGame isn't available for macOS—stuck at a missed layover in Frankfurt and I WANT TO PLAY. Those turns!
No but seriously speaking, it feels like @ThumperGame is the best thing that has happened to rhythm games in a while. So much to love.

@GolDDranks @Regzoz @ssspaju @DHawku But in any case for handling REST JSON data, I'd strongly recommend getting into lenses, regardless of framework: 
@GolDDranks @Regzoz @ssspaju @DHawku React with some data mangling going on.

OTOH I can't not use Calmm.js anymore because it's so good.
Well this was certainly a fun group to be against in Mystery Heroes. Spoilers: we were all squishies. #Overwatch

A covfefe is just a comonoid in the category of multifunctors.
Published a simple form validation example for #calmm in React. Also features a simple validation DSL! 
@Petterroea Well that’s, uh, yeah nope. Can’t think of anything to reply to that other that WAT
@Regzoz Also, paikat jotka ei kuulu Tokioon 👌👌👌
There's also a sense of magic with composing optics, because you're not necessarily used to things "just working".
There's an entirely new and exciting world with using lenses, where when you first get the gist of them, they turn out to be very powerful.
Two months into this React project, and zero `this`, `new` or `class` keywords in the codebase. Lovely!
State in this case is just a lensed view into some data that will be passed on.
Thus, any field will behave in a predictable manner since its output is—sans keyboard input—solely dependent on the state you give it.
This also allows for creating grouped optics where you're passing the value _and_ validation to your form fields.
The result, combined with L.pick, is a structure of all invalid data. Then, form-level validation is just `result.map(R.isEmpty)`.
Form validation through lenses is brilliantly simple: specify your validation through L.when and similar operations.
This makes me unreasonably upset. 
A bit old, but still surprisingly relevant 
@CirNobar Also you can use Rodinal and not have to worry about grain, too. Gets a bit in the way with 35mm.
@literallyshoujo Around 4am yeah, it’ll just get brighter. This is in Southern Finland.
Last time I was up at this hour is quite a long time ago. Loving the light Finnish summer nights! 
On another note, also a fun learning experience is to reimplement Promises and Streams by yourself.
Fun little learning process and at the same time get reminded of what's running your stuff.
Try writing your own small utility belt library for the fun of it. Write map, compose, pipe, seq &amp; friends, then exapdn from there.
@mvirkkunen Pretty much. 330MB update saying “please keep this up to date” doesn’t really entice me to update.
A sure-fire way to make me not update your app. #mildlyinfuriating 
I'm having the worst case of XY Problem right now, that I just realized many hours later. Hard to relearn.
But in general the advantage of using (partial) lenses is being able to narrow the spec on data to fit whatever constraints your usage has.
Certainly they're good for a lot of things in general, but tackling down to specific features is a bit like a kid in a candy shop.
I had an interesting discussion yesterday on the topic of lenses and what they're good for.

You also get a chance to practice how to better work with lenses, from a specified set of required features.
A very good way to get into #Calmm: implement TodoMVC. It contains a nice set of features that are pretty valid in "real" apps.
I suppose this is a substance-free party, since there’s no side-effects involved. Just in-the-zone Haskell programmers.

@VesaKarvonen A fitting analogy might be using the Tesla automatic parking feature, after going to driving school. Maybe.
@VesaKarvonen And some operations just felt _wrong_ in the beginning, due to badly optimized rec’s in imperative ones.
@VesaKarvonen No wonder, though, since how things are done in the FP world differ quite radically from the imperative one I was used with.
@VesaKarvonen I’ve to admit that after diving into Haskell _a lot_ of operations I wasn’t familiar with before started making sense.
Had to made some arts &amp; crafts, but the mental model that made me “get folds” years ago. 
@punakone Ei
In any case, jumping into the world of FP brings about an entirely new world of new discoveries!
In a sense, the C# alias for folds, aka `aggregate` may feel less abstract, in a way?
Had a hard time understanding the use of `reduce` until the name `fold` was introduced, which gave birth to this showerthought.
What happens when you fold something onto something else is your folding function.
As in, take a strip of paper, divide it into equals chunks (your items), fold one unto another.
Wondering: when explaining folds in programming, has anybody explained it as if folding a paper strip? That’s the way they made sense to me.

Have been so busy with a work project that I haven’t had much time to work on pet projects lately at all. Might not be the worst problem.
I repeat, today is Pi Day only if you use the stupidest date format in existence.
@punakone Kaikki nää taidepiirretyt
@SLVR79 You can just ROLL AROUND ALL DATY
That late night thought when you realize how you should do effectful actions in #calmm, and your previous implementation is WRONG. #owoe

@SLVR79 NEVER. Never stop.
@punakone jotkut asiat ei muutu…
@CirNobar Konosuba S2, what a pleasant surprise over S1 derpiness. Feels like Milky Holmes train episode all the time.
Now I don't have to keep track of my installed Homebrew packages in case I need to reinstall. Yay!
In unrelated news, set up a local Ansible playbook to set up the base tools that I use for a new system.
Maybe for a future project in any case.
But since this is a fairly critical thing to get up and running soon, I don't feel enough confidence in doing it just yet.
A project for creating an application base to be used for a client's future applications. Would _love_ to do this in Elm.
@MerryNitemare Every time I hear about the healthcare in the US, the more it seems like a developing nation in terms of healthcare.
@VesaKarvonen @autiomaa Yeah, agreed. Fascinating to see that there are some fresh takes on tackling state consistency in the UI.
@VesaKarvonen @autiomaa There’s a kind of paradigm shift that’s happening, I think, in simplifying presentation, e.g. stateless components.
@VesaKarvonen @autiomaa Something I didn’t notice until a while ago, comparing JS frameworks with something like Elm, for instance
@autiomaa Imperative approach, be gone!
@autiomaa Semi-related, but using Riot's timer example to how things could be done with #calmm for instance: 
@autiomaa @elmlang The language has gone _heaps_ forward since then. It's a joy doing stuff with Elm, due to how things are done there.
@autiomaa I'd almost want to give @elmlang a whirl, but I fear that this particular project might be a bit too critical considering my skill
@autiomaa @andrestaltz Moving into FRP is the bomb. Brings up a bunch of useful concepts really nicely suited for UI stuff.
@autiomaa The common ground for these is that they use streams for everything, more or less, which is really good.
@autiomaa Quite a lot of React through #calmm, which has a really good approach to this. CycleJS is another really good one.
@autiomaa Because you can get deterministic behaviour for your UI controls. If you have local state that becomes really complicated.
@autiomaa Yeah, encoding application state and decomposing said state to stateless components helps out a lot with this.
@autiomaa Usually a majority of state can/should be encoded in the application state, since local state introduces a lot of manual labor.
@autiomaa Even still, it seems like something that could be encoded into the application state if needed. Minimal local state etc
Might just be a feeling and might be unfounded, but mixing logic and `this` in HTML-ish syntax feels a bit odd.
Maybe dabbling around with #calmm in the past month+ has spoiled me with its niceties?
Going to have to dive a bit into this, but all this local state is giving me a bad feeling.
Looking at riot.js, due to work-related projects. I'm getting AngularJS flashbacks, mixed with Razor MVC.
New job started with a bang; yesterday intro day. Today, going to the client.
Happy!

I think this is a fairly good measure how much I’ve liked Norway and the scenery the past ~1.5 years. 
Safe to say, I think they were not open for business. #norway #hardangervidda 
@gloom303 I have no strong opinions (anything goes), but "pizza with pineapple" is old German that means "national socialism".
@Touniss sanomista nyt ainakin!
@TheHat2 Well, people usually understand things how they’re relative to something else. Plus rose-tinted glasses, better before etc.
@gloom303 Depends entirely on how Hitler you are
Even almost 1.5 years after moving to Norway the smaller roads can play tricks on you. Road construction work during winter is fun! 
Well, it’s a good thing “I’ll just go for a drive” has never escalated by accident or anything.

Flight to Helsinki on wednesday tho, so time to finish at least this #calmm-related writeup then.
I'm going to curse myself for being too much of a perfectionist all the time. All these post drafts. /cry
Usually I'd end up wondering why something is not working and thinking about why am I doing this in the first place.
Working with #calmm has yanked me out of the XY problem numerous times, something I'd guess on working through a different approach.
@jet_moebro Sounds more like a viral infection tho, usually bacterial infections don’t go too high.

@hotred820 *me just thinking about monoids in the category on endofunctors and stuff*
Could definitely live without this common cold right now. Head. Not. Working. At. All.
@_cmdv_ Seriously thinking about rewriting some internal stuff at work to use #PureScript modules, and then migrating the rest.
@_cmdv_ The perfect cat-keyboard! Maybe you need a larger one when your furry baby grows bigger?
@drboolean @marcfawzi It starts of with basics of lambda calculus, since it’s the foundation, and holds your hand really gently. ♡
@drboolean @marcfawzi The book by @haskellbook does a really good job in this regard.
So awesome @getify 
@mvirkkunen So you’re saying it’s good, then?
In any case, something to look into. Could be fun!
That'd open up some cleaner possibilities of concat and folds, in a way.

Back up to the National Parks in Norway. Can't wait!

Apparently, the weather's going to be bad this weekend in any case, soo...
But OTOH, going to drive my .fi car back to Norway next week, so there's a good chance for going around places then.
Would definitely hit the spot to rent a car for this weekend and go roadtripping, and watch the scenery.
@ferristweetsnow Thanks man, appreciate it. Wasn't sudden (luckily) in this case, but in both good and bad, the closure to it always sucks.
@Petterroea Hasn't apparently accounted all the plays. been a couple of playcount resets, too. :P

@Petterroea Aria is the go-to series if you ever need to relax, all three seasons of it. Had to go to Venice thanks to it. :P
@Petterroea That's already bordering on iyashi-kei. Pretty good series, too. Like Hidamari Sketch.
@Petterroea short summary would just be “nothing bad happens, no conflicts”
@Petterroea genre would be “iyashi-kei”, aka healing. Like slice-of-life, but even better.
@Petterroea Eatch Yokohama Kaidashi Kiko, it’s like 3+2 eps. Relaxation as its best.
Hahahahaha

&gt;app that requires you to go outside
&gt;complain like this 
@Petterroea ...feel like slow-TV, in a good way.
@Petterroea Kobayashi is pretty good, same with Gabriel Dropout. Although, compared to those, things like Aria, YKK and Tamayura...
In any case, I think I will need to rewatch Aria and Yokohama Kaidashi Kiko. Those two were soo good, and might be just the thing I need.
Some day I will also have this kind of soft-looking hairball around. SOME DAY. 
Are there any good slow and healing shows on this season? I would be very happy to hear suggestions.
@robotlolita Waiting for the next episode is suffering. Such a feel-good show.
Oh my, a new @infected album out? Time to put it for a spin!
Ok yeah goty hands down thank you sega 
@mvirkkunen STOP TALKING TO YOURSELF
Well, sleep, any time now. I'm waiting.
@VesaKarvonen ...things just seem to make sense. And it almost always results in really descriptive code.
@VesaKarvonen Noticed that there's a tendency to fall into the XY problem and asking the wrong questions. But once you get past that...
@VesaKarvonen But oh man how much cleaner most of the stuff is now, lovely!
@VesaKarvonen Oh, damn, you're right. I'm thinking these stumbles are just not being used to working with lenses and traversals much yet.
Luckily, R.update exists. Hail!
Going into the land of lenses, current trouble mainly: update items in a list. But I have a feeling that it's an easy combination with ramda
@literallyshoujo Thanks. Life goes on, but it’s never fun when it happens.
@Miamikicchi Thanks. Didn’t come out of the blue but still sucks when it finally happens. Luckily moving back to .fi next month tho!
But, life happens.
Seems like there'll be a funeral for a dear relative in the coming weeks. Not the kind of event that I'd expected to have to think about.

@GolDDranks Get out of here with your burritos. I'll go have mine at Burrito Project tommorrow.
Thank you, functional programming. Won't run out of interesting stuff at least!
But why not? It's super interesting, and helps to boost my shattered confidence and self-image of being useless at math since middle school.
And why am I still up at this hour studying category theory and drawing commutative diagrams of morphisms on bills.
On that note, I miss Northern Finland. It’s lovely, at any time of the year.
But I want to go on a roadtrip so bad. Two months since the last, and the scenery in Norway is something I’ve always dreamed of.
On that topic, I might finally be grasping how everything works in Haskell. Terminology a bit confusing at first, for some reason!
Tomorrow, back to Finland for a nice extended weekend. Even tho it’s really flat, it’s still home. ♡

@EmilJenz Yay! Yeah that picture-slightly-off-on-the-side is just a VGA issue, luckily Glorious Digital Connections aren’t plagued by that.
@EmilJenz If it’s using VGA, there should be an auto settings option for it (button labeled “auto” or somesuch?)
@EmilJenz using a VGA connection? If not, monitor settings? Mine have sometimes shitted themselves.

Time to get this week rolling. 
@jet_moebro Funny thing somehow, that the big series' CG is bad, while we have Etotama with 6/5 ace stuff.
@punakone Nyt loppu se BRRYn juonti tähän aikaan päivästä.
@CirNobar Daymn, nice! R09 has the added bonus of sharpening things a little bit, too.
After all this time I think I finally have started "getting it" in terms of applicative functors. Makes for cleaner #js too. &lt;3
@CirNobar Not sure if you've pre-soaked before, but helps with eliminating any possible air bubbles on the film among other things.
@CirNobar Yeah, color varies by stock, but that's basically the anti-halation backing that's washed out.
@CirNobar Oh yeah, also if you don't have windows in your bathroom, that works great as a changing bag substitute.
@CirNobar But when you get used to stand dev, it's 6/5. Change ISO mid-roll? No prob!
@CirNobar IMO 120 rolls are a bit easier than 135, since they have less stuff to put on the spool
@CirNobar If you have a roll you can butcher, worth trying out in daylight to get comfortable.
@CirNobar Actually temp isn’t super important in stand dev, as long as it’s within 15-25 degrees. Colder results in smaller grain IIRC.
@CirNobar then just leave for 30mins, agitate calmly twice or so, then leave for another 30, and finish like normal. Magic〜♪
@CirNobar basically 1:100 dilution, pre-soak film in water for 5min, after then pour in developer and agitate slowly 1-2 times
@CirNobar worth trying out with a leff important roll at first, but
@CirNobar Excellent. Just need 5ml for a roll of 120 to develop, and you will enter your grave before it goes old!

@Petterroea But 6/5 help for getting sleep. Or getting your ass to bed, because you feel that "natural" tiredness.
@Petterroea That stuff is basically the hormone that the brain produces and makes you tired. OTC in Finland, actually.
@Petterroea Fuck yeah melatonin and muscle relaxants.
It's a great way to shift your thoughts into realizing how many side-effects you're implicitly relying on in imperative languages.
Going into languages like Haskell is a great way to realize how trivial stuff like getting a random number isn't that trivial in the end.

On a related note, might need to head to sleep. Will be a long monday ahead tomorrow.
@sukeyotafumi ｶﾞﾌﾞｯ
But this might be the Finn in me talking. There's a piece of truth in stereotypies.
@jet_moebro Granted, some things are pretty expensive here. But I guess the laid back atmosphere offsets it quite a bit.
@jet_moebro Luckily I have a car; around 1-1.5 hour trip to Töcksfors or Svinesund, cheap Swedish food!
@jet_moebro ...or work here, since the median pay for a lot of jobs are twice that of what they're in Finland.
@jet_moebro That just happens to be an issue if you're poor tho.
That's at least the Finnish-Swedish perspective to this. Balanced just fine. Not Sweden or Finland. &lt;3
There's this laid back feeling I get here, that I usually experience up north in Lapland.
Of course, friends, family and the world's best girlfriend still live there, but still.
Norway feels much more like a home now than what Finland has felt most of the time.
I've to make a confession tho.

@Petterroea But I have to agree though, C# is actually pretty… fun!
Lovely Kapp i Toten last night. Must go there again. Also didn't have time to process these.

@ssspaju Kun on vähän just niin, että hirveä kasa libejä jotka tekee samaa mutta eri nimellä; object-assign, assign-object, merge...

How are people staying sane and developing anything with React nowadays; no major upgrades and suddenly things just cease working. #fuck
Ah, we were all there once 
Seems much nicer to act on Justs/Nothings rather than checking for null all the time.
Using monads instead of plain data in React applications seem to work wonderfully at least from my initial experience.
A few things make me want to punch someone as much as "Rebuilding font cache".

@GolDDranks Monad Lisa amirite
But handling and parsing data from a weird API is much more comfortable that way. Extra effort pays off with absence of "!= null" checks.
I'm blaming @drboolean for sparking my love for FP and making me dive back into Haskell and Erlang again. And I'm loving it!
The Kancolle API data can be made so much more nicer to deal with by using monads. #truestory

@PaulTown_ @NepTet lel posting MV even ironically
＜◉＞＜◉＞ 
@Miamikicchi Plus in the process of rewriting most of the stuff so that you can write with reactive data bindings on sequences. Loving it.
@Miamikicchi Yeah, most of the data is "there", was just a horrible mess to transform it into something usable. Except for the combat data.
@Miamikicchi Some Japanese guy has a list on things which has a number of スペルミス注意 notes in it. And they are accurate...
@Miamikicchi And of course mixed conventions and typos; most are api_-prefixed, some are "spi_", probably "api" but with typo.
@Miamikicchi As in, some arrays are 0-based, some are 1-based with '-1' in [0], while '-1' in general means "empty".
@Miamikicchi Not sure what the correct word for it would be fitting, but I'll draw parallels to PHP and the Necronomicon. Combined.
jeweler sent us this proof of my wedding ring! 💍 cc @HoeflerCo 
The (real) scientific method. 
Note to self: add Hindley-Milner type signatures to composable functions. JSDoc and Flow doesn't really cut it.
So sorting by stats is much faster than the current solutions out there have you doing.
Data binding, sorting and lookup is super-fast, since most of the heavy lifting is done during game start and in the background.
Not much has changed on the visible side, more under the hood. Proper #FP stuff. I love it!

Not for the coworkers, though. #yolo #sorry
@eevee Compared to games like VVVVVV and the like, they're as unfairly difficult, but the time from failure to retry is much shorter.
@eevee Something I thought about yesterday as well, because for me, the difficulty in DS feels a bit artificial, like in Civ 5.
The patent diagram for it remains a thing of beauty to this day.

@jet_moebro Of course. Kusoteitoku didn’t wife my ship etc. If you take it as something entertaining it’s actually pretty good.

I have this feeling that we're going to look back to these things and wonder we were thinking around then.
...that's leaking to other things that used to be much more straightforward.
Definitely not meaning "everything used to be better", because that's a lie. But it feels like the Grunt.js overconfiguration philosophy...
It all feels so convoluted, and getting PHP-ish vibes here with a bunch of libraries that do the same thing but under a different name.
After adding React, Redux, a router, and the necessities, Webpack was screaming at over 1100 modules.
Of course these things are learnable, but before adding anything React and Redux to my project, I used around 13 modules.
Had a longer break from front-end related stuff. I don't know anything anymore. React-related stuff is a really a mess.
@eevee But as it seems the laws were changed in 1971 the last time, so… might need a review or two.
@eevee From what I’ve heard (friends) is that even if not having surgery it would be required.
@eevee But still just hearing that changing gender means (forced) sterilization kinda doesn’t sound too right.
@eevee Luckily it’s gotten some attention, since passing laws on same-sex marriages last yeat.
@eevee Had to doublecheck, according to Wiki; “A person has the right to change his or her legal gender in Finland only if [..] sterilized.”
@eevee This reminded that Finland is ass-backwards in this; trans people must undergo forced sterilization by law. “thanks, gov’ment”
Started doing some front-end stuff after being out of it for a couple of weeks. Super frustrating to set up a live-reloading project.
@insomniacgames Any plans for international release; Finland/Norway?

@punakone ei tosin oo tollasta 100%, mut oli kiva ylläri kun tuli celshadettua CG:tä joka oli ihan helvetin kivannäköstä.
@punakone joka itseasiassa oli aika kiva sarja näin retrospektissä. Vois kattoo uusiks.

@ferristweetsnow But finishing things is boring, because there's all that maintaining and trying to make "sense" of stuff you've done before
@ferristweetsnow Also, riding to the danger zone... 
@ferristweetsnow Speaking of new and interesting stuff; some have cljs, then there’s  — danger impending.
@ferristweetsnow Personally, have started to feel less bad lately about that—it’s all good stuff that can be applied to other things.
@ferristweetsnow But everything exciting and new and awesome is just that!

Which reminds me, should look up places that develop #largeformat 4x5 film in #Oslo.
Best thing about the current job though; variation, lots of possibilities to learn. Love it.
I just realized that it's been over 6 weeks since I began my work at @fusetools. Time sure does fly.
Still a bit stuck, looking for places to live near #Oslo. Horrible problems: so many good places!

Getting that roadtrip travel fever up again. Watching #nrk #minuttforminutt go past Magerøya soon, hoping to take a trip up there again.
@SeriousSlav Let's go to Makino right away.

Nice to know that #nrk is still going strong with its #minuttforminutt series. This is what I'd call "healing TV".
I'll probably get used to it in a few days, though.
Not sure if it's just generally hard to get a rest in hotels, since the past weeks have been quite a rumble.
@shco9ke Uh oh. Saw ひだまり荘 in マキノ when I was there four years ago, too...

@DoctorMacky Tuntuu vähän ristiriitaiselta kun kansanedustajat ei oikein tunnu tekevän sitä nimenomaista tehtävää..
Kertoo paljon nykyisestä hallituksesta, että sen ylivoimaisesti suurin saavutus on oman lakiesityksen peruminen. #opintotuki
Mitä ihmettä tästä hallituksesta on enää jäljellä, kun hallituspuolueet vetävät kilpaa tukensa omilta esityksiltään? #hallituskriisi

First episode of Cross Ange watched. I feel renewed. Like I've woken up from a bad dream, into a world of perfection.
@niidelj I'm sorry, what year was it? Apartheid A.D.?

@codeflows Yeah, that's the article that kind of started this. Still 50/50 about it..
I like my waifus how I like my functions — pure and without side effects. #ahue #waifu #waifuthings #truth
@ze_hilda Yeah, that’s true. One of the downsides with the ecosystem being relatively new.
@codeflows CLJS looks interesting. Did some Coffeescript for a while, but ended up not liking it much. Kind of turned JS into somethibg else
@codeflows It's become much better now, but still.. think of the lifecycle with Backbone, Angular, now React.
@shadikka Nosiis, en tiiä onks vaan angsti mut, jotenkin hirveen turhautunu fronttijuttuihin. En tiiä onkse se yleinen meno vai mikä.
Most likely I'm feeling like I'm lost or at a loss with where I'm going. Or maybe I've realized this isn't my "thing"?
Dunno how to explain it without sounding like an old man. Because I really like to learn new things!
Most of these frustrations have realised themselves after diving into a multitude of other languages.
Nothing against Javascript itself, but somehow I'm feeling increasingly frustrated with the general ecosystem for it.
Feels so frustrating at times, especially since the livecycle of frameworks are what they are.
I've to admit, that I'm kind of getting tired with front-end -related stuff. Maybe I'm just phasing into full-stack dev instead.

@SLVR79 I could go on forever about how it works in photography, almost like I'd have assburgers about CA.
@SLVR79 But it's a nice effect that gives a certain texture and style to it.

@SLVR79 Actually, thinking about how the RAW tool's "corrections" might affect images.
@SLVR79 oic. Was interesting, since the color channel shift seemed pretty nice in the end! Must experiment, then...

Luckily, I have a bunch of super cool people in my life. It makes all the difference.
It's one thing to have slept lousily the past week, but what I'd do to not think about things that "could have been".

Note to self: scan to 48-bit _RAW_, instead of 48-bit TIFF. Makes such a big difference in editing...
That might explain why getting the colors correct was such a horrible process.
That feeling when you've been scanning color negatives entirely long the entire time.

@SLVR79 Also, it looks like an N64-made movie, but it came out in 2013.
@SLVR79 There was this one guy who streamed the movie ever since it was released, but it got taken down… :’(
@SLVR79 And so addictive, because I don’t know what the fuck why am I watching this again oh god.
@SLVR79 Also, apparently it was in making for over ten years, cost 60M+, and made ~62k on its release. Also, apically shitty.
@SLVR79 It’s a nice, 2-hour-long animated product placement commercial. tl;dr, so to speak.
Awesome. Got antibiotics for sinusitis. So I wasn’t crazy, and my upper jaw hurting had a reason?!

@Nueazz Vois olla mielenkiintoista kyllä testata, toi on atm 12.5k x 10k pikseliä kooltaan, reson vois bumpata tietty vielä 2400-&gt;4800dpi...
@Nueazz Ilmeisesti skanneri vähän derpisti tarkennettu, mutta mfw 1:1 zoom

The most horrible part? Seeing legacy-JS from 2009-2010 written for IE7, that I wrote back then. The complete lack of namespaces.
React.js is a pretty fresh breeze to writing UI-related stuff, and seems to pair pretty well with Angular.

Without mentioning the x*n different templating languages, frameworks and compile-into-JS -languages. Fuck.
While node.js is a blessing for some stuff, it feels even more fragmented than Linux distros. Package managers everywhere.
Meh, React seems nice but goddamnit. Another templating language that IDEA doesn't have support for yet. Making this really difficult.
@SLVR79 Found this book that I got on the trip. Reminded me of you. 
@CirNobar @MrMisterSwift Now just sole creamy tones and you have Portra mmmyes

うわ、梅酒もうない (*´Д｀)
@antonrissanen Also oh god now I notice how horrible Twitter is in English, compared to Japanese.
@antonrissanen But those are more of a gripe I hold to weakly typed languages.
@antonrissanen Hopefully we'll get more compile errors, rather than just syntax errors.
@antonrissanen For instance CoffeeScript not allowing named functions, which is poo.
@antonrissanen Making certain decisions instead of me on the way.
@antonrissanen I think my main grudge is that Coffeescript et.al. are compiled to JS.
@antonrissanen Yes, they are. Didn't mean that they weren't. They're at least compiled straight to bytecode.
@antonrissanen Or just head into Java/C#/et.al., too many compiled-into-JS things. Makes a man sad.
Which reminds me, I've to look more into TypeScript.
@antonrissanen But these things would be so much better with strong typing, IMO. Too much leeway with "maybe" in arguments.
@antonrissanen I do believe that's a matter of personal preference and coding style, though, done through convention.
@antonrissanen If I were using a shitty editor, I most likely wouldn't. But that's a matter of coding convention.
@antonrissanen Which I think is part of the problem with JS, being too liberal about types.
@antonrissanen Of course, weak types so in the first example, "list" can be whatever you want.
@antonrissanen Of course I would—since it's a function referring to its own method, vs. referring a method in an implicit list.
@antonrissanen But those examples are folly, since there's a lot more assumed; concat being a prorotype of function, for instance.
@antonrissanen And for instance in the retarded world of DOM events, if you want to pass a reference along with it explicitly.
@antonrissanen For simple functions the first one, but for class structures, assumed identity is better IMO.
@antonrissanen of course, JS != Java/C#, but the functionality is sufficient.
@antonrissanen Personally, having done more OO, I like thinking of objects in the way classes are in e.g. Java/C#, where they are of use.
@antonrissanen Isn't it an issue of preference? One addidional argument in .call/.apply vs giving it a context?
@antonrissanen Naturally, frameworks assume certain decisions on your part, and you have to live by them.
@antonrissanen But those cases I am binding context by hand.
@antonrissanen I find it useful in event propagation, especially when I have a clearly defined API for it.
@antonrissanen But that's largely more a language-wide issue with it not being able to catch errors on compile time.
@antonrissanen Depending on the library, too. I still think that JS has some legitimate use of 'this', but it's more of a special case.
@antonrissanen Because if you consider 'this' in languages Java, or Ruby's 'self', then you have better use for it.
@antonrissanen I'm meaning that usage of 'this' is mostly unclear in JavaScript, due to its prototypal inheritance logic.
@antonrissanen And finally, of course, 'this' in FP is redundant, since you're manipulating data, unlike in, say, OO, where it has uses.
@antonrissanen That said, not sure if React is trying to be FP or not, since I haven't much experience with it.
@antonrissanen Same with other cases, some times you need functions with side effects, too.
@antonrissanen Depends on if you're doing FP or not. FP has its uses, as does OO.
@antonrissanen JS' concept of 'this' is a double-edged sword, which would be much more efficient if it were like in C# or Java.
@antonrissanen How come? I'm turned off by JSX, but I like the way it's derived into classes.
